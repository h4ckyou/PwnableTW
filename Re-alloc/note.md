This was a really interesting challenge because i wasn't able to solve it the first time i attempted it

It is a standard heap exploitation challenge where you can allocate, free and reallocate memory

Some constraint here is that we can't edit any chunk, we can't only make small sized allocation, no use after free and we are limited to just 2 unique allocations
